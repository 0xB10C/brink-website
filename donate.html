<h2>Donate</h2>

<p>Brink was founded in 2020 with generous funding from John Pfeffer and Wences
Casares. We are 100% funded by donations from members of the public and
sponsorship from Bitcoin businesses.</p>

<p>Brink Technology, Inc is a Delaware nonprofit corporation (EIN 85-2919136). We
have applied for 501(c)(3) status, and our 1023 application is currently
pending. If we are successful in our application, donations to Brink from U.S.
taxpayers will be tax-exempt, including those made during our application
period.</p>
