Brink was started with a simple mission: _Strengthen Bitcoin by Supporting
Bitcoin Developers_. Critical to that mission is our ability to raise money to
fund our [grant][] and [fellowship][] programs.

Making the organization as tax efficient as possible ensures that donors' funds
are used to the maximum possible benefit of the mission, and also encourage
potential donors who might otherwise not be able to support us. In the U.S.,
[501(c)(3)][501c3] status is an I.R.S. designation for charitable organizations
which allows taxpayers to donate to the organization and claim a deduction on
their federal income tax. Furthermore, donations of long-term appreciated
assets like Bitcoin generally don't incur capital gains tax and can be claimed
as an income tax deduction for the full fair-market value.

We therefore knew that gaining 501(c)(3) status would be hugely beneficial to
our donors and to advancing our mission. We applied to the I.R.S. for 501(c)(3)
status shortly after incorporating the organization in September, and we're
delighted to announce that we received confirmation this week that 501(c)(3)
status had been approved. Donations to Brink are therefore tax deductible under
I.R.C. section 170, including donations already given.

We applied for 501(c)(3) status under three [exempt charitable purposes][exempt
purposes]:

1. **Research** - we support, design and publish research related to
   cryptocurrency. All results of this research and/or development of related
   technology such as software is made available to the public gratis.

2. **Education** - we provide education and materials to our fellows and the
   general public using a variety of methods, including dissemination or
   publication of guides, manuals, and blogs, among other possible resources. The
   materials are made available for free on the website.

3. **Maintenance of Public Infrastructure** - we maintain, design, and
   develop software made available to the general public, gratis and under
   open source licenses. This software, when run voluntarily by members of the
   general public, forms a peer-to-peer network. This network is a public payments
   and communications infrastructure developed and deployed as a benefit for the
   general public.

Gaining 501(c)(3) status means that our existing donations can be used more
effectively and that more potential donors will be in a position to support
Brink. Over the coming weeks, we intend to work with [Donor-Advised
Funds][DAFs] to make it even easier to support Brink.

Special thanks to Adam Jonas at Chaincode Labs for doing some [initial
research][jonas 501c3] into how to start a 501(c)(3), and to [Peter Van
Valkenburgh][valkenburgh] at Coin Center, who gave invaluable advice in the
early days. And of course, thanks as ever to our [founding sponsors][] John
Pfeffer and Wences Casares, without whom none of this would be possible.
